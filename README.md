# 🔍 Step 1: SQL-Based Data Analysis

These SQL queries helped explore and understand the financial dataset before visualization.

### ✅ Insights Extracted Using SQL:

1. **YoY Revenue Growth per Company**
   - Query calculated year-wise revenue growth (%) for each company.
   - SELECT company, year, revenue,
    LAG(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY year) AS previous_year_revenue,
    ROUND(
        (revenue - LAG(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY year)) 
        / NULLIF(LAG(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY year), 0) * 100, 
        2
       ) AS yoy_revenue_growth_percent
       FROM financial_data
       ORDER BY company, year;


2. **Top 5 Companies by Average ROE**
   - Identified companies with the highest average Return on Equity.
   - select company, round(avg(ROE),2) as avg_ROE 
   from financial_data 
   group by company 
   order by avg_ROE desc 
   limit 5;

3. **Companies with High ROE and Low Debt-Equity**
   - Filtered companies that had high ROE (above average) and a low debt-equity ratio.
   - select company, category, year, ROE, DebtEquityRatio 
     from financial_data 
     where ROE>20 AND DebtEquityRatio<1 
     order by ROE desc;

4. **Category-Wise Average Net Profit Margin**
   - Displayed average profitability across different industry categories.
   - select category, round(avg(NetProfitMargin),2) as avg_Netprofit_margin 
     from financial_data 
     group by category
     order by avg_Netprofit_margin desc 

5. **Top 5 Companies by EBITDA Margin**
   - Ranked companies with the most efficient operations by EBITDA margin.
   - SELECT company,
    ROUND(AVG(ebitda / NULLIF(revenue, 0) * 100), 2) AS avg_ebitda_margin
    FROM financial_data
    GROUP BY company
    ORDER BY avg_ebitda_margin DESC
    LIMIT 5;
     

✅ These insights built a strong base for dashboard design in Power BI.
